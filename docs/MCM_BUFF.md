# M.A.R.A.S – Current Buffs MCM Page 📊💞
*“Okay but how much power am I actually getting from this harem?” – You, probably.*

The **Current Buffs** MCM page is your **live dashboard** for all marriage-related bonuses you’re currently getting:

- Left side: how your **spouse-followers** are boosting you in the field.
- Right side: how your **marriages as a whole** are empowering you in everyday life.

Nothing here is editable – this page is **pure info**, so you can see the result of all your choices, drama, ranks, and affection… without accidentally breaking anything.

> **Why do these numbers look like this?**
>
> - [Archetypes & Buffs](ARCHETYPES_AND_BUFFS.md) – base values for every social-class buff and follower buff.
> - [Affection System – Deep Dive](AFFECTION_SYSTEM.md) – how affection tiers (happy/content/troubled/estranged) scale buff strength.
> - [Player Guide](PLAYER_GUIDE.md) – how polygamy and hierarchy ranks redistribute permanent buff power.
> - [NPC Explorer MCM](MCM_NPC.md) – where to change individual NPC archetypes, affection, and ranks if you need to tweak things.

## Left Column – Follower Buff from Spouses 🚶‍♀️⚔️

Header: **Follower buff from spouses**

This section shows **one line per Skill Type**:

- Warrior
- Mage
- Rogue
- Craftsman
- Ranger
- Orator

Each line looks like:

> `Warrior    0.75`
> `Mage       1.25`
> `Rogue      0.00`
> …and so on

That number on the right is the **multiplier** for that skill type’s **follower buff**, based on:

- Which of your spouses are currently **following** you
- How much they **like you** (affection thresholds)
- How many you have (and how the system blends them together)

It doesn’t show the **raw percentage**, but the **multiplier** applied to the base buff for that archetype. For example:

- Base Warrior follower buff is “Bond of Steel” (more melee damage).
- A multiplier of **1.0** = full base value.
- A multiplier of **1.25** = strong affection making that buff a bit better.
- A multiplier of **0.0** = no active buff for that type (no such spouse following, or affection too low).

### Tooltips: The Actual Effect 🧠

Hover over any skill type (Warrior, Mage, etc.) and the tooltip will:

- Show the **name + description** of the buff (e.g. “Bond of Steel – increased melee damage”).
- Show the **final calculated effect** with the multiplier already applied.
- Include the **unit**, such as “% melee damage” or “% magicka regen.”

So the lines in the list show **how strong that archetype stands overall**, and the tooltip tells you:

> “With your current followers and affection, this is the exact bonus you’re getting right now.”

Use this to:

- Check whether your “combat spouse” is actually pulling their magical buff weight.
- Decide which spouse to bring along for dungeon delving vs. sneaky runs vs. shout-happy dragon hunting.

## Right Column – Permanent Buff from Spouses 🏡♾️

Header: **Permanent buff from spouses**

This side shows **one line per Social Class**:

- Outcast
- Poverty
- Working
- Middle
- Wealthy
- Religious
- Nobles
- Rulers

Each entry shows something like:

> `Nobles    0.50`
> `Working   2.00`
> `Rulers    0.00`

Again, the number is a **multiplier** applied on top of the base social-class buff:

- Outcast → “Kiss of the Knife” (sneak attack damage)
- Poverty → “Enduring Hearts” (stamina regen)
- Working → “Labor's Legacy” (carry capacity)
- Middle → “Steady Kinship” (skill XP gain)
- Wealthy → “Merchant's Dowry” (sell prices)
- Religious → “Blessing of Union” (magic resistance)
- Nobles → “Aristocratic Favor” (store prices)
- Rulers → “Speech of Sovereigns” (Speech skill)

This multiplier already takes into account:

- How many spouses you have in that social class
- Their **hierarchy ranks** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th+)
- Your **total spouse count** (single spouse vs. harem)
- Their **affection level** (happy/content/troubled/estranged)

So:

- A multiplier of **2.0** likely means: single spouse in that class + very good affection.
- A multiplier of **1.0** means: full normal value.
- A multiplier of **0.25** or **0.1** means: they exist, but either low-ranked or emotionally distant.
- A multiplier of **0.0** = you’re getting nothing from that social class (no spouse or completely estranged).

### Tooltips: Real Final Numbers 📐

Hover over a social class line (e.g. “Wealthy”) and the tooltip will:

- Show the **buff description** (“Merchant’s Dowry – increases your sell prices…”)
- Show the **final effect** after applying that multiplier (e.g. “X% sell price bonus”).
- Show the **unit** so you know whether it’s a % bonus or a flat value.

This is where you see the payoff of:

- Marrying that noble you liked for the discount.
- Promoting a certain spouse to 1st rank.
- Keeping everyone’s affection high enough that they actually share their perks with you.

## What You Can Do Here (and What You Can’t) ✅❌

- ✅ You **can**:
  - Inspect how strong each buff category currently is.
  - Hover for precise numerical effects.
  - Use this info to decide whom to marry, promote, travel with, or charm back into “happy” affection range.

- ❌ You **cannot**:
  - Edit values directly here (no sliders or menus on this page).
  - Manually change multipliers – they come from the rest of the system:
    - Affection
    - Rank
    - Spouse count
    - Follower status

If you want to nudge things around, you’ll need to:

- Adjust affection (via NPC Explorer page, in-game behavior, or cheating).
- Change hierarchy ranks in the NPC Explorer.
- Switch which spouses follow you.
- Or, you know, marry more people. For science.

## TL;DR – Why This Page Is Awesome

The **Current Buffs** page is the place you go when you want to answer questions like:

- “Am I actually getting anything from my noble spouse or are they just sitting in Proud Rank 4 doing nothing?”
- “Is it worth bringing my craftsman spouse along on this dungeon run?”
- “How much sneak damage am I really getting from all these sketchy Outcasts I married?”

Whenever your brain goes:
> “I feel powerful but I want to see *numbers*,”

this page is your cozy, nerdy, marriage-math sanctuary. 📈💕
