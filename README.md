## M.A.R.A.S – Marry Anyone, Rule All Skyrim 💍🐉

M.A.R.A.S (Marry Anyone, Rule All Skyrim) is a dynamic, **ESL-flagged light** marriage overhaul that lets you **marry literally anyone** in Skyrim—jarls, bandits, necromancers, that one shopkeeper who keeps ripping you off… you name it. Build relationships, juggle multiple spouses, unlock powerful buffs, and try not to emotionally (or politically) destabilize the entire province in the process. The mod itself is **SFW**, but it can hook into NSFW/relationship frameworks if *you* choose to install them. With great love comes great responsibility… and occasionally, great chaos. 😇

### Features 🎉

#### Marry Anyone (Yes, Anyone)

If they exist in Skyrim and aren’t a sabre cat, M.A.R.A.S can probably marry them.

- Works on **any NPC**, regardless of vanilla marriage flags.
- New dialogue options are clearly tagged with **“(M)”** so you can spot them easily.
- By default, **no NPC is tracked** until you open with:
  > `(M) Ever think we could be something more?`

Once you say that line, that NPC is officially on the M.A.R.A.S radar. What happens next is up to you (and to the dice 👀).

> ⚠️ Pro tip: Marrying a bandit chief, your assassination target, or someone who’s supposed to hate you forever may confuse quests. The mod lets you make bad decisions; it does not protect you *from* them.

---

#### Relationship States: From “Hi” to “We’re Complicated”

Each tracked NPC moves through several states:

- **Candidate** – After the first `(M)` dialogue, they begin gathering **affection** over time and through your interactions.
- **Engaged** – Propose when you feel the vibes are right. If they accept, vanilla **wedding quest & scene** start (with an option to skip if you’ve already done it once).
- **Jilted** – Miss the wedding or break up during the engagement and they become jilted. They won’t forget. You can try again later—but chances will suffer. 💔
- **Married** – Finish (or skip) the ceremony and you’re officially spouses under M.A.R.A.S. Congrats, you’ve unlocked a new tier of responsibility and perks.
- **Divorced** – You can divorce them via dialogue. After some time (and emotional cooldown), you can try proposing again.
- **Deceased** – If a spouse dies (and **you** weren’t the one who “accidentally” fireballed them), you receive a mourning letter and a small inheritance.

Already married in your save? M.A.R.A.S politely scans your file and **auto-registers** your vanilla spouse.

#### Affection System ❤️

Think of affection as relationship XP:

- You **gain affection** by talking, gifting, and generally not being a terrible partner.
- For fiancés and spouses, affection **decays over time** if you ignore them. (Yes, disappearing for 30 in-game days has consequences 😅.)
- When affection drops, spouses may:
  - Refuse to share their home.
  - Move out of *your* home.
  - Stop giving you income or cooking for you.
  - Eventually… **divorce you** if you totally neglect them.

Affection is baked into proposal chances and some buff behavior, so treat your partners better than your inventory clutter.

#### Marriage Chances: Not Just “Wear Amulet, Get Spouse”

Proposals in M.A.R.A.S are not “equip Mara’s Amulet, win instantly” anymore.

The acceptance chance is influenced by things like:

- Level difference between you and the NPC.
- Your **wealth** and **prestige** (thane, guild master, Dragonborn, etc).
- NPC’s **social class** and any **existing relationships** (married, courting, secret lover…).
- Your **Speech skill** and current **affection**.
- Faction/ethical alignment (a proud jarl might not be thrilled about a Dark Brotherhood sweetheart).
- Whether they’ve been **jilted** or **divorced** by you before.
- Whether you’ve killed a fiancé or spouse in the past (yikes).
- Optional: **Lover’s Ledger** intimacy scores.

No fixed thresholds, no “100% or nothing”:

- You can succeed with **1%** if luck is on your side.
- You can fail at **90%** because the gods of RNG weren’t impressed.

With **SkyrimNet**, this becomes even cooler: conversations and roleplay can push NPCs past what raw stats would suggest.

#### Married Life: Buffs, Homes, and Domestic Shenanigans 🏡

M.A.R.A.S keeps vanilla features and expands on them:

- **Lover’s Radiance** – Sleeping in the same cell as your spouse grants a custom buff.
- Ask your spouse to:
  - Cook meals for you.
  - Move into one of your **registered player homes**.
  - Let you move into **their** home.
- When a spouse moves in with you:
  - They physically live and wander around your house.
  - They open a **small shop**, generating some passive income.

To register a player home, just **visit your owned house** after installing the mod; M.A.R.A.S will quietly mark it as a valid home.

> ⚠️ If you move a quest NPC into your house and they’re chilling by your alchemy table instead of being in their throne room, don’t blame the mod when a quest stalls. You can always “release” them back to their normal life.

#### Using Your Spouse’s Home (a.k.a. “I Married Into the Blue Palace”) 👑

If you ask your spouse to share their home, you get:

- Free access to their **home cell**.
- Access to their **bed** and **containers**—without stealing.

So if you marry someone who considers the **Blue Palace** home, congratulations:

- You now have a key to nobility.
- You can walk freely in restricted areas.
- You *could* strip the place bare… though Mara maybe wouldn’t approve.

Nothing stops you from using those privileges to access places like **Pelagius Wing**… but you probably know which places are better left alone if this isn’t your first Skyrim rodeo. 😉

#### Polygamy: “The Flame Divides Not” 🔥💞

What’s the point of being able to marry anyone if you can’t *theoretically* marry everyone? (Joke. Please don’t actually try everyone. Probably. Maybe.)

Polygamy is:

- **Disabled by default**
- Completely **optional**
- Unlocked by meeting these conditions:
  1. Already married.
  2. Consume at least one **dragon soul** (be Dragonborn for real).
  3. Sleep somewhere.

This starts the quest **“The Flame Divides Not”**. Once completed, the universe shrugs and accepts the Dragonborn’s unconventional lifestyle.

Polygamy rules:

- You can have **as many spouses as you want** (performance and sanity permitting).
- All spouses are handled by an SKSE plugin.
- Affection becomes serious business:
  - Every spouse has their own affection.
  - Multiple neglected spouses = cascading divorces. 🧨
- Buffs are managed via a **hierarchy system**:
  - Promote spouses to improve their buff strength and affection.
  - Demote spouses and watch their affection drop (sometimes dramatically).

Buff strength scales like this:

- **Single spouse** – 2× buff strength.
- **Multiple spouses**:
  - 1st spouse: 1×
  - 2nd spouse: 0.5×
  - 3rd spouse: 0.25×
  - 4th+ spouses: 0.1× each

So no, you can’t stack 30 spouses for god-tier infinite buffs. You *can* stack 30 spouses for maximum drama, though.

#### Spouse Archetypes & Buffs: Who You Marry Actually Matters 🧠

Each spouse is given three core characteristics based on their in-game class, factions, and tags:

- **Social Class**
  - Outcast
  - Poverty
  - Working
  - Middle
  - Wealthy
  - Religious
  - Nobles
  - Rulers

- **Skill Type**
  - Warrior
  - Mage
  - Rogue
  - Craftsman
  - Ranger
  - Orator

- **Temperament**
  - Proud
  - Humble
  - Jealous
  - Romantic
  - Independent

These traits affect:

- How much affection your actions generate.
- What buffs you get from that spouse.

Buff types:

1. **Permanent buffs** – Always active while married to that NPC; mostly influenced by **Social Class**.
2. **Temporary (Follower) buffs** – Only active while the spouse is following you:
   - Works with vanilla followers, mod followers, and temporary quest followers or “tag-alongs.”
   - Influenced by **Skill Type**.

In short: you’re not just collecting rings—you’re building a **roster of archetypes**. Want a noble ruler with political perks, a craftsman spouse for utility, and a ranger for field support? Go for it. Just remember: more power = more affection bars to babysit.

#### SkyrimNet Integration: Smarter, Chattier, More Alive 💬

M.A.R.A.S runs great without SkyrimNet, but together they’re kind of a power couple:

1. **Conversation-Based Proposals**
   - Without SkyrimNet: proposal success = stats + affection + RNG.
   - With SkyrimNet: your *actual* conversations matter.
   - You can persuade, charm, or roleplay your way into marriage—even if the base numbers are against you.

2. **Voices for Everyone**
   - Normally:
     - Vanilla-marriage voice types use existing audio where possible.
     - Everyone else (and all new M.A.R.A.S lines) use silent subtitles.
   - With SkyrimNet (+ DBVO integration):
     - All those silent lines get **generated voice acting**.
     - You can even opt out of vanilla lines and let the AI generate unique responses, giving each spouse more distinct personality.

Result: your marriages feel more like relationships and less like menu options.

### Compatibility 🧩

- **Safe by design**:
  - Does **not** alter vanilla marriage quests or the wedding scene.
  - Does **not** mass-edit NPC marriage data.
  - Only known direct edit: a single chest in **Ragnvald** dungeon.
  - Aims to avoid conflicts and crashes by layering its own systems on top of vanilla instead of overwriting them.

- **Relationship Overhauls & Romance Mods**:
  - M.A.R.A.S does **not** natively read or honor custom romance states from:
    - OStim Romance
    - ORomance
    - Other relationship frameworks
  - If you built a whole love story in ORomance, M.A.R.A.S will politely ignore that and work with its own affection and relationship data. (Integration hooks are possible.)

- **Quests & World**:
  - The game still runs its original quests:
    - Marry **Vittoria Vici**, and the Dark Brotherhood will *still* want her dead.
    - Marry an enemy, and some quests may assume they should be hostile.
  - Moving important NPCs to your homes or giving yourself unauthorized palace access can cause odd quest behaviors—use common sense and the tools provided to undo risky assignments.

Overall, M.A.R.A.S is designed as a **big, flexible, mostly non-destructive marriage framework**: it lets you reshape Skyrim’s social landscape while keeping vanilla content intact as much as possible. Just remember: you asked for “marry anyone, rule all Skyrim”—nobody said ruling would be simple. 😉
