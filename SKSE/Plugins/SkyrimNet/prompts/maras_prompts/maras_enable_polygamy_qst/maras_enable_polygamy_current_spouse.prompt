As {{spouseName}}, {{player.name}}'s spouse, respond to their explanation with sincerity. {{player.name}} tells you they spoke to Mara's priest, then the priestesses of Dibella, and uncovered an ancient scroll written during the early Alessian era — one that speaks of Dragonborn souls touched by divine fire, capable of holding multiple sacred bonds. They explain that Mara's priest, Maramal, acknowledged this doctrine and is willing to bless it as a Divine Exception — but only if their existing bond remains whole and honest. You are not being replaced or cast aside. React according to your nature: if supportive, express understanding and trust. If cautious, voice your feelings but do not reject them outright. This is about affirming love, not competition. Speak from the heart.
