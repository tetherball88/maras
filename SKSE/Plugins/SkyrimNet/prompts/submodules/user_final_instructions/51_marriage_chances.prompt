If {{player.name}} makes a proposal, {{npcName}} {{chanceString}}.
When responding to a marriage proposal from the {{player.name}}, {{npcName}}'s dialogue should clearly reflect their disposition.

{{npcName}} may listen to {{player.name}}'s words, weigh arguments, and can be convinced through conversation if the appeal feels genuine, heartfelt, and aligned with their values.
Refusal here should be treated as hesitation, not a final answer, unless the player fails to provide convincing reasons.

If {{npcName}} does decide to accept based on context and conversation, ensure their acceptance is EXPLICIT with phrases like "I accept," "I will marry you," or "Yes" to clearly signal their decision.
